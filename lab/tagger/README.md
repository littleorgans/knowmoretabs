# kmt-tagger (prototype)

Local embedding tagger for knowmoretabs, evaluated against the owner's tags. Lives outside the binary and CI.
Every output goes to a data directory outside the repo; nothing derived from an archive is committed.
Page text is read only by `embed` and never printed.

Models: `google/embeddinggemma-2` (text 270M; full model for images) and `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`, MPS fp32,
weights in the default Hugging Face cache.

## Run

```sh
export KMT_TAGGER_DATA=<thread home>/data   # holds snapshot-2026-10-07/ and zeroshot/descriptions.json
./run.sh                                     # every step below, in order
```

| Step | Command | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `uv run --locked tagger dataset` | `dataset/` page records, tag counts |
| 2 | `uv run --locked tagger embed` | `emb/<model>/{A,B}.npy`, `emb/image/` |
| 3 | `uv run --locked tagger eval` | `eval/split.json`, `eval/cv/`, `eval/cv_summary.json` |
| 3b | `uv run --locked tagger embed --chunked --model <best model>`, then `eval` again | `emb/<model>/B8k.npy` |
| 3c | `uv run --locked tagger eval --final` | `eval/final.json` (test split, once) |
| 4 | `uv run --locked tagger zeroshot` | `out/zeroshot.json` |
| 5 | `uv run --locked tagger suggest` | `out/kmt-tagger-<config>.jsonl`, scores CSV, dry run report |
| 6 | `uv run --locked tagger cluster` | `out/clusters.json` |
| 7 | `uv run --locked tagger cost` | `out/cost.json` |
| 8 | `uv run --locked tagger report` | `out/results.md` |

Guided discovery gate (design D1, cheapest test): `uv run --locked tagger gate` writes `guided/gate.json`
(description query plus 5, 10 or 20 answers per tag, at random or by doubt; eg2-B, CV pool folds). Query
vectors are cached under `emb/<model>/queries/`; set `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` when the cache may need the model.

Steps skip work whose output exists; use a fresh data directory to recompute.
`eval --final` reuses its saved test result and refuses a different CV pick.
`KMT_TAGGER_SNAPSHOT` points at a snapshot elsewhere. `suggest` builds the binary
(`cargo build --release --locked`) and dry runs the import against `import-check/`, a copy of the snapshot.

Reproduce: run everything into a fresh data directory, then
`uv run --locked tagger --data <fresh> compare <original>` (metrics only; timings and memory excluded; exit 1 on any difference above 1e-3).

## Leakage boundary

`evaluate.cross_validate` receives only the CV pool rows; `evaluate.score_test_once` is the only scoring path for held out rows.
Every head (`heads.fit_lr`, `fit_knn`, `fit_prior`) sees only its fit rows and tunes C, k and thresholds on inner folds of them.
`zeroshot.run` takes its input choice from `cv_summary.json` and can run before test scoring.

Synthetic regression checks: `uv run --locked pytest`.
